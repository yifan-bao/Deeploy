# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Updating dependencies"
    - python3 -m venv ./env
    - source ./env/bin/activate
    - git submodule update --init --recursive
    - git checkout dumpotest
    - git checkout dumpocmsislibs
    - python setup.py install

network-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - source ./env/bin/activate
    - cd dumpotest
    - python generateNetwork.py -t Tests/simpleRegression
    - cd ..
    - make -C dumpotest/Platforms/QEMU_ARM/ clean all run
